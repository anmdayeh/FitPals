FitTogether — Complete Prototype
=================================

What's included:
- index.html — main page (static client-only prototype)
- style.css — styles
- app.js — client-side logic (uses localStorage)
- README.txt — this file

How to use:
1. Unzip the package and open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox).
2. On first load the app creates demo data. Use 'Reset demo data' to recreate sample data.
3. Save profile in the onboarding card.
4. Use Daily Entry to add/edit entries. Click entries in 'Recent Entries' to edit or delete.
5. Join a group (name + password) to enable chat (stored locally).
6. Export CSV via the Export CSV button.
7. All data is stored locally in your browser's localStorage under the key 'fit_package_v1'.

Notes & next steps:
- This is a client-only demo. For real users, add server-side storage, authentication, image uploads and integrations.
- The package is intended as a functional prototype that works out of the box in a browser.
